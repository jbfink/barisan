Welcome to Barisan!

Barisan is a project submission framework for digital humanities. It's nowhere near completion yet, but when it's done, it should be able to:


1) Accept project submissions.
2) Allow some species of backend ranking/commentary on projects
3) Spit out (in csv format?) a list of projects and project submitters.
